# Memory Card

This project is part of the Odin Project's Curriculum React Course. The main goal of this project was to implement the concepts I have learned so far by using hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API.

The API I chose to use is Lorem Picsum - https://picsum.photos/

## Description

The goal of this game is to click on each card on the board without repeating any card. The cards reshuffle after each click, so you have to pay close attention to not click on any previously chosen card. Successfully click on each card without clicking on the same one twice to win.
